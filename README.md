# 📊 Dual Axis Sales Dashboard – Tableau Project

This Tableau dashboard analyzes sales performance against targets using a **dual-axis chart** and interactive filters. Built with Tableau Public, the dashboard provides clear, insightful visual comparisons of actual sales versus goals across different product categories over time.

## 🧠 Objective

To visually compare **Sales** and **Target** values from 2011 to 2015, and highlight overperformance or underperformance using an **Excess of Target** metric. This helps stakeholders quickly spot trends, gaps, and growth opportunities across categories.

## 📈 Key Features

- ✅ **Dual Axis Chart** – Combines bar (Sales) and area (Target) charts for visual comparison.
- 📉 **Excess of Target Analysis** – Additional chart showing the difference between actual and target sales.
- 🧭 **Interactive Filters** – Drill down into specific categories like Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies.
- ⏳ **Time-Series View** – Covers a 5-year span for historical trend analysis.
